    """Decision logic function for car agents.

    This function defines the discrete decision-making logic for car agents.
    Currently implements a simple pass-through behavior where the agent
    maintains its current state and mode.

    IMPORTANT: This function is processed by VERSE's custom parser, which may
    behave differently from standard Python execution. The parser analyzes the
    function to extract discrete transition logic for formal verification.

        ego: Current state of the car agent
